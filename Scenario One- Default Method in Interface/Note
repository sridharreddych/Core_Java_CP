Java 8 has introduced default method as well as static method that can be defined in interface. Default method is a normal java method but starts with default keyword and static method is declared as usual with static keyword.
Why Default Method in Java Interface?
A question comes in mind why java has introduced default methods in interface. Suppose a tractor manufacturer company has published standard interface to operate the tractor like how to take gear or break etc. Developer has developed different type of tractors implementing the standard tractor interface. What if company adds a new functionality in its standard interface like how to jump the tractor? Developer needs to do changes in their class to define new methods which is not a nice approach. Now we need here default method to handle this situation to avoid rewriting all classes implementing standard tractor interface. Define the default method in interface and it will be available in all classes implementing tractor interface.
Why Static Method in Java Interface?
Stating from Java 8, an interface can have static methods. A static method is associated with a class not with the object. Static method works as helper method. So if we declare static methods in interface, it is easy for us to organize our helper methods.
