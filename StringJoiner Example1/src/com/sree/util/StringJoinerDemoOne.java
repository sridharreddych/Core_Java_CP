/**
 * @author Sridhar reddy java.util.StringJoiner has been introduced in Java 8.
 *         StringJoiner is a util method to construct a string with desired
 *         delimiter. If required we can also add prefix and suffix to the final
 *         string. To achieve it, StringJoiner is created with two constructor,
 *         first is only with delimiter and second has delimiter, prefix and
 *         suffix. We can merge two StringJoiner. Find the description and
 *         example. StringJoiner(CharSequence d) This constructor uses a
 *         delimiter to separate the added element.
 *         StringJoiner.add(CharSequence element) StringJoiner.add method adds
 *         element to it. We need to call add method every time as the number of
 *         elements to be added.
