java.util.function.Predicate is a functional interface introduced in java 8. Predicate is used for assigning a lambda expression. The functional interface is test(T t) which returns Boolean value. When we pass the object to this method, it evaluates the object over assigned lambda expression. Find the two expressions below.
Predicate<Student> maleStudent = s-> s.age >= 20 && "male".equals(s.gender);
Predicate<Student> femaleStudent = s-> s.age > 15 && "female".equals(s.gender); First expression creates the scenario for a male student and second expression creates the scenario for female student. Find the complete example.
