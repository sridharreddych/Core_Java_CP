 *         Scenario One: Default Method in Interface To understand using default
 *         method, I am creating an interface Village that has some method
 *         declarations and one default method. Default method starts with
 *         default keyword. By default all methods of interface will be public,
 *         so no need to use public keyword to declare and define methods in
 *         interface.
